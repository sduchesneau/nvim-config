pt.txt*   Plugin that integrates pt with Vim

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                               *pt*

This plugin is a front for the_platinum_searcher: pt. Pt can be used as a
replacement for ack. This plugin will allow you to run pt from vim, and shows
the results in a split window.

:Pt[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Pt*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:PtBuffer[!] [options] {pattern}                                    *:PtBuffer*

    Search for {pattern} in all open buffers. Behaves just like the |:grep|
    command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given
    the first error is jumped to.

    Note: this will not find changes in modified buffers, since pt can only
    find what is on disk! You can save buffers automatically when searching
    with the 'autowrite' option. A buffer will be ignored if it is a directory
    (an explorer, like netrw).

:PtAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                               *:PtAdd*

    Just like |:Pt|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:PtFromSearch [{directory}]                                     *:PtFromSearch*

    Just like |:Pt| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LPt [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                   *:LPt*

    Just like |:Pt| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LPtBuffer [options] {pattern}                                     *:LPtBuffer*

    Just like |:PtBuffer| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are
    placed in the current |location-list|.

:LPtAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                             *:LPtAdd*

    Just like |:PtAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:PtFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                             *:PtFile*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:PtHelp[!] [options] {pattern}                                        *:PtHelp*

    Search vim documentation files for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
    |:Pt| command, but searches only vim documentation .txt files

:LPtHelp [options] {pattern}                                         *:LPtHelp*

    Just like |:PtHelp| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed
    in the current |location-list|.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence. <Enter> on a
line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

OPTIONS                                                            *pt-options*

                                                                     *g:pt_prg*
The location of the Pt program, and any options you want passed to it before
searching. Default: "pt --vimgrep" (for parsable output). Example: >
  let g:pt_prg="pt --vimgrep --smart-case"
<
Note: the `--vimgrep` option was added in Pt 0.25.0. If pt.vim detects that
you're using a lower version, the following default will be used instead: >
  let g:pt_prg="pt --column --nogroup --noheading"
<
This works around inconsistent behaviors in earlier Pt versions, but it is
recommended that you upgrade if possible for a better experience. `--vimgrep`
supports multiple matches on the same line of text, for example.

                                                               *g:pt_highlight*
If 1, highlight the search terms after searching. Default: 0. Example: >
  let g:pt_highlight=1
<

                                                                  *g:pt_format*
Format to recognize the matches. See 'errorformat' for more info. Default:
"%f" when searching for files, "%f:%l:%c:%m" if not otherwise set. For
example, if your `g:pt_prg` is set to just "pt" (no column numbers in the
output, so when you jump to a match your cursor will be on the start of the
line): >
  let g:pt_format="%f:%l:%m"
<

                                                         *g:pt_apply_lmappings*
Whether or not to add custom mappings to location list windows opened by this
plugin. Only applies if you're using the location list. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:pt_apply_lmappings=0
<

                                                         *g:pt_apply_qmappings*
Whether or not to add custom mappings to quickfix windows opened by this
plugin. Only applies if you're using the error list. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:pt_apply_qmappings=0
<

                                                                *g:pt_lhandler*
A custom command used to open the location list after it's populated.
Default: "botright lopen". You might want to set this to change where the
location list is opened, or what size it is. Example: >
  let g:pt_lhandler="topleft lopen"
<

                                                                *g:pt_qhandler*
A custom command used to open the error list after it's populated. Default:
"botright copen". You might want to set this to change where the quickfix
window is opened, or what size it is. Example: >
  let g:pt_qhandler="copen 20"
<

                                                         *g:pt_mapping_message*
Whether or not to show the message explaining the extra mappings that are
added to the results list this plugin populates. This message is not shown if
the mappings are not applied (see |g:pt_apply_qmappings| and
|g:pt_apply_lmappings| for more info. Default 1. Example: >
  let g:pt_mapping_message=0
<
